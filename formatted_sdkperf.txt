Here is your knowledge on Sending and Receiving Messages: The Solace PubSub+ platform, which includes the appliance, software, and cloud products, provides high-performance global event message routing for applications connected to a Solace event mesh. The following sections discuss how event messages move through PubSub+ event brokers as well as some power-user capabilities and specialized features. Understanding this information will help you avoid writing code that mimics existing event broker capabilities so you don't waste time solving problems that have already been solved by the PubSub+ event broker's standard features. Definitions The following terms are used in the process flow diagrams later in this section. A brief description is included here, but you can find in-depth explanations by following the links provided. Hierarchical Topics PubSub+ event brokers use hierarchical topics to define the event streams available to clients. You can use wildcard masking against those topics to further refine the information available to your organization. For more information, see Understanding Topics . Of particular interest, PubSub+ event brokers have a number of reserved or special topics that make it simple to configure a range of capabilities like queue routing, message promotion and demotion, and disaster recovery. You can find out more at Reserved Topics.  Information about general topic syntax can be found at SMF Topics. Persistence vs Durability Although the terms persistent and durable are related,  keep in mind that the concept of persistence applies to event messages, whereas durability applies to endpoints. Persistence refers to the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of event messages, which can be classified as Persistent (Guaranteed) or Non-Persistent. Event messages are considered persistent if they are placed onto non-volatile storage media after they arrive on the broker. The broker's Data Plane stores a message if the message arrives with the Persistent Delivery Mode set to Persistent, or if a queue or durable topic endpoint has subscribed to a topic where messages are persisted regardless of the Persistent Delivery Mode flag setting in the message.  If an event message is sent with Persistent Delivery Mode set to Direct, which is synonymous with Non-Persistent, the message is only placed onto the non-volatile storage media if the message is subscribed by a Queue or a Durable Topic Endpoint. Messages flagged as Persistent result in an acknowledgment message being sent back to the producer after the message is stored.  Endpoint Durability is a characteristic of a PubSub+ queue or topic endpoint. These endpoints are state engines that control references to persistent messages in the Persistent Event Streams.  Durable endpoints operate whether or not consumers are active. For example, queue messages will still be available after a broker fails or there is a High Availability (HA) or Disaster Recovery (DR) failover. Therefore, messages are considered to be persistent in a general sense if they are associated with a Durable Queue because they stick around independent of the life span of particular client session or event broker restart. Temporary queues aren't considered to be durable. Messages to temporary queues are persisted to storage, but they're deleted if the active temporary queue consumer unbinds or disconnects. Therefore, with non-durable endpoints, the endpoint is not durable beyond the life of the consumer. To find out more about durable and non-durable queues, see Topic Endpoints and Queues. Event Streams PubSub+ separates incoming events into two separate streams depending on the QoS required for the events (as defined by the producer) as they are moved from producers to consumers. These Non-Persistent Event Streams and Persistent Event Streams process events using different paths. The following sections show you, step-by-step, how that processing takes place. Non-Persistent Event Streams Non-persistent events are ephemeral. These events provide a QoS for consumers where loss of messages is acceptable, and use a design pattern where consumers only receive messages starting from the time of connection. This allows for extremely high throughput and ultra-low latency as a trade-off against longevity. This QoS is also commonly used forMessage Exchange Patterns  such as Request-Reply or Publish-Subscribe in applications like market data. When event messages arrive at the broker with Delivery Mode set to Direct, the message is placed at the tail of the Non-Persistent Event Stream. Non-durable consumers receive messages from the Non-Persistent Event Stream by attracting topic messages on a subscription basis. As new event messages arrive at the broker, they are placed in the consumer’s egress queue if they correspond to the client’s subscription request. Each Direct message has an assigned priority. The consumer’s egress queue ensures higher priority Direct messages are processed before lower priority ones. Messages of the same priority are processed in the order they arrive at the broker. In the diagram below, you can follow a non-persistent event as it is processed by the PubSub+ event broker. The detailed steps of this process flow (corresponding to the numbers in the diagram) are as follows: To find out more about the  components that are involved, see the following: Data Plane Tasks for Incoming TCP Events All messages enter a Solace PubSub+ broker via custom ingress TCP buffers. The arrival of new TCP event messages cause the Data Plane to move the TCP data to the Non-Persistent Event Stream for further processing. However, it should be noted that messages are only moved to the event stream if they pass ingress ACL processing.  Messages in the Non-Persistent Event Stream are ephemeral, and message discard is acceptable. All messages, including messages that are flagged with a Persistent Delivery Mode set to Persistent or Direct are first placed into the Non-Persistent Event Stream when they arrive over TCP/IP. The Data Plane immediately moves messages flagged as Direct to the consumer's egress queue where the consumer has a matching topic subscription.  Messages flagged as Persistent are immediately placed into the Persistent Event Stream. If the persisted mode messages are discarded before they are processed into the Persistent Event Stream, the producer API ensures redelivery to the broker, and the Persisted Event Stream will automatically discard redelivered duplicates. Once the messages pass the ingress ACL check, they are placed in the Non-Persistent Event Stream, and are further processed by the Data Plane, as follows: Some messages will have arrived with the Persistent Delivery Mode set to Direct, but a queue may have a topic subscription for those messages. Topic messages subscribed to from queues are promoted to Persistent, and moved to the Persistent Event Stream, but no ACK is sent to the producer. For more information about promotion, see Message Promotion and Demotion. Some messages will arrive in the Non-Persistent Event Queue that have the Persistent Delivery Mode set to Persistent. However, there may be topic subscribers who want the same message while it's being moved to the Persistent Event Stream. This message is demoted to Direct for delivery directly to the consumer egress queue for ultra-low latency and high throughput processing for consumers who don't require guaranteed delivery. Further information about demotion can also be found at Message Promotion and Demotion. Based on an indication from the producer, the message is placed into one of three consumer egress queue priority streams. For more information refer to Client Egress Queue Structure Overview. Messages can be delivered in a round-robin fashion to a group of topic consumers to provide load balancing similar to non-exclusive queue processing. More information can be found at Shared Subscriptions. All messages from the TCP network are placed directly into the Non-Persistent Event Stream. If the message's Persistent Delivery Mode is set to Persistent, the message is moved and persisted against the Persistent Event Stream. Event messages are logged in real-time based on multiple conditions ranging from threshold settings to messages arriving without any subscribers. This is a log of message activity, not tracing of the full message. Information about configuring logging for various APIs can be found in Configuring Logging. When consumers indicate they want specific topic messages for Direct mode delivery (including demoted messages), the attracted topic messages are now referenced in the consumer’s egress queue for processing to the TCP outbound buffers. A reference to the messages in the Non-Persistent Event Queue that are scheduled for TCP delivery to specific consumers. The reference will only be added to the egress queue if the consumer’s security ACL profile allows the delivery. For more information refer to Client Egress Queue Structure Overview. The following diagram illustrates the tasks performed by the Data Plane: The following discussion and links provide information about the components illustrated in the diagram. Non-Durable Temporary Queues There are several message exchange patterns (MEP)s where there's no requirement for a persistent queue to exist beyond the life of a durable consumer. These queues are called temporary queues; this type of queue is active only while the consumer that created it is active. Temporary queues are very often used for producers that make use of the Request / Reply MEP, where the reply messages are only relevant while the producer exists. In the following diagram, you can follow a message as it's processed on a Non-Durable Temporary Queue: The detailed steps of this process flow (corresponding to the numbers in the diagram) are as follows: The following links provide information about the components illustrated in the above diagram. Persistent Event Streams  Event messages are considered to be persistent if they are placed onto non-volatile storage media after they arrive on the broker. Persistent messages are suitable for application design patterns where the event messages must be: Persistent events are commonly used for MEPs where loss and duplication aren't tolerated, for example in financial transaction applications.  Persistent events require more processing than non-persistent ones.  PubSub+ event brokers use different paths for these two message types to ensure that the respective processes don't interfere with each other.  Persistent event messages are processed in three main phases that are discussed in detail in later sections: Producer-Side Processing of Persistent Events Event producers can send event messages using a guaranteed QoS by setting the message's Persistent Delivery Mode to Persistent. This flag  instructs the broker to reply to the producer with an acknowledgment when the broker has stored the message in durable storage (including HA and / or DR replication).  In the diagram below, you can follow a persistent event as it is processed by the PubSub+ event broker. The detailed steps of this process flow (corresponding to the numbers in the diagram) are as follows: To find out more about provisioning a durable queue, see Configuring Queues. Data Plane Tasks for Persistent Event Streams The Data Plane operates on queue endpoints. For persistent event messaging, a queue endpoint maintains state for all messages in the Persistent Event Stream that are targeted directly to the specific queue, or are part of the queue's topic subscriptions. There are three main functional categories associated with a queue endpoint: The arrival of a new event message on the Persistent Event Steam causes, among other things, an update of the queue endpoint's state engine to add a pointer for the newly arrived message.  However, even if the queue endpoint has registered interest in a topic in the Persistent Event Stream, that doesn't guarantee the state engine will update the queue endpoint with a pointer to the new message. All messages must still meet the required access controls before the queue endpoint will reference the new messages. If a consumer binds a flow to the queue endpoint in order to receive messages in guaranteed delivery QoS, it still doesn't ensure the consumer will actually receive all the messages that are referenced in the queue endpoint state engine. Guaranteed delivery QoS consumers still must be authorized at the queue level before they can consume or produce guaranteed messages that will be updated in the queue endpoint. Guaranteed consumers may also define a selector where only a subset of the queued messages will actually be sent to the consumer. For more information about selectors, refer to Using Selectors page. A newly arriving persistent message does more than update the queue endpoint record list. The Data Plane also triggers checks and related processing operations for the following broker features: Message Replay is a Solace PubSub+ feature that allows a broker to resend messages to new or existing clients that request them, hours or even days after those messages were first received by the broker. More information can be found at Message Replay and in the Replaying Messages section below. Processing against the messages in the queue endpoint, the message could be removed because of a TTL (time-to-live) setting, or a poison message redelivery setting. The message is removed from queue endpoint reference, and is automatically added to a dead message queue associated with the original queue endpoint. You can find more details in Configuring Dead Message Queues.  The message may need to be replicated to the HA member before it's considered persisted in the primary HA broker. More information can be found in Event Broker Redundancy for High Availability. The message may need to be replicated to the DR broker cluster  before it's considered persisted in the primary HA cluster. There are more details at Data Center Replication for Disaster Recovery. If multiple queues are set with reject-msg-to-sender-on-discard, a failure to spool the same message in any one of the queues with the reject-on-discard setting, then that message is rolled back for all co-operating queues, and the producer is sent a negative acknowledgment. You can find more information at Reject Message To Sender on Discard. The messages produced or consumed from the queue can be bracketed in either session or XA transactional semantics. More information can be found in Sessions and Using XA Transactions. The diagram below illustrates various tasks performed by the Data Plane: The components shown in the diagram are as follows: Consumer-Side Processing of Persistent Events Durable consumers process messages from the Persistent Event Stream by creating a flow against the queue endpoint. The Data Plane moves messages to the consumer egress queue. In the diagram below, you can follow the processing of a message to a consumer. The detailed steps of this process flow (corresponding to the numbers in the diagram) are as follows: To find out more about the  components that are involved, see the following: Exclusive and Non-Exclusive Durable Queues A durable queue can provide one of two types of access for consumers: Exclusive or Non-Exclusive. Both attract persistent messages even if there are no active consumers bound to the queue. For information on how to set a durable queue's access type, you can refer to Configuring Access Types on the Configuring Queues page, but a brief summary of the two types of access is provided in the next sub-sections. Non-exclusive queues provide load balancing and fault tolerance to durable consumers, and allow multiple consumers to bind a flow to the same queue endpoint.  Messages are delivered to consumers in a round-robin fashion to provide load balancing. If a consumer fails, its unprocessed messages are forwarded to an active consumer to ensure fault-tolerance for the consumers. If new consumers are bound to the queue, the load is automatically distributed among the newly joined consumers against the non-exclusive queue. Exclusive queues provide fault tolerance to durable consumers. More than one consumer can bind a flow to the queue, but only the first bound consumer receives any messages. If the processing consumer fails, the next bound consumer will receive any unprocessed messages from the first consumer, and become the active processing consumer. The diagram below provides overview information about exclusive and non-exclusive queues.  The detailed steps of this process flow (corresponding to the letters in the diagram) are as follows: To find out more about the components illustrated above, see Queue Access Types. Replaying Messages PubSub+ supports four different replay strategies. Which one you decide to use depends on your requirements and use-cases.  Message Replay is a PubSub+ feature that allows an event broker to resend messages to new or existing clients that request them, hours or even days after those messages were first received by the event broker.
With replay enabled, event brokers store persistent messages in a replay log. For more information refer to Message Replay. When PubSub+ detects a session disconnect-reconnect event, the queue endpoint will automatically replay all messages to the consumer that were in flight, or being processed by the consumer, but were not acknowledged. All replayed messages on the session have a flag indicating they were replayed due to consumer session restart. Information on configuring the maximum redelivery attempts for a durable queue can be found in Configuring Max Redelivery Attempts. PubSub+ supports a special consumer called a Queue Browser, which consumes messages by replaying messages from a queue, but without the queue endpoint expecting an acknowledgment, or referencing the messages as consumed. For more information refer to Browsing Guaranteed Messages. PubSub+ Cache an external in-memory data grid for high-speed and low latency storage on non-persisted messages. Replay is by topic, and based on message depth or time. For more information refer to PubSub+ Cache. The following diagram shows you where each of the above replay strategies fits into PubSub+ event message processing.  The following discussion and links provide information about the components illustrated in the diagram.
