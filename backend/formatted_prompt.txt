Here is your knowledge on What is Solace PubSub+ Platform?: Solace PubSub+ Platform is a complete event streaming and management platform for the real-time enterprise. The Platform helps enterprises design, deploy, and manage event-driven architectures (EDAs) across hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, and IoT environments, so enterprises can be more integrated and event-driven.

In addition to this, you can manage your event broker services whether they are located in the cloud or on-premises, easily visualize and design event meshes, securely centralize the management of your EDA, and easily scale to drive your EDA forward. Event Management PubSub+ Event Portal provides  event management services that give you the power to create, design, share, and manage your events whether they come from PubSub+ event brokers or other streaming technologies (such as Kafka). The Event Portal offers runtime discovery and cataloging of events, schemas, and application interactions. You can easily generate code and documentation, validate events, and apply API management policies for applications in your EDA. Event Insights
